## Summary

WordPress Starter Theme for use as a starting template for building custom themes. Using modern front-end stack like SASS, Javascript ES6, Bower for dependencies management and Gulp for all processing tasks. Syncs changes across local development devices with BrowserSync.

## Usage

The theme is setup to use [Gulp](http://gruntjs.com/) to compile SCSS (with source maps), run it through [AutoPrefixer](https://github.com/ai/autoprefixer), lint, concatenate and minify JavaScript (with source maps), optimize images, and syncs changes across local development devices with [BrowserSync](https://github.com/shakyShane/browser-sync), with flexibility to add any additional tasks via the Gulpfile.

- Install dependencies by running `bower install`
- Install package by running `npm install` (maybe require `sudo npm install`)
- Edit your theme information in `src/scss/_config.scss`
- Change your theme folder name in `gulpfile.js`
- Using gulp to execute tasks by running `gulp`

### Deployment

- Run `gulp build` to build the production theme
- Add `screenshot.png` to the production theme
